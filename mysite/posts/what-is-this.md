## Write your post here.


When youâ€™re done writing your post, you must rebuild your site to make it visible on your site. Run nikola build again.

Note that the list of files is much shorter now: Nikola does fast, incremental rebuilds (courtesy of doit). Nikola built only the pages for this post, the indexes, the feeds, and the previous post (to add a Next post navigation button). All the demo pages and assets were left untouched, saving you time and resources (it does not have to work on building some larger things, and rsync will not have to upload everything)
